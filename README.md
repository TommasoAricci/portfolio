<h1>Hello everyone and welcome to my HTML & CSS project..</h1>

<h2>In this project, I wanted to show the skills I have acquired so far during the Web Developer course.</h2>

<h3>The pages</h3>

The website is divided into three main pages: <em>Who Am I, My resume, Contacts</em>.

<ul>

<li>On the main page I briefly explain who I am, what motivated me to become a web developer, and the companies I would like to collaborate with..</li>

<li>Inside the page <em>My resume</em> I list what have been the most relevant work experiences, then I move on to the links of my works and the web skills I have acquired..</li>

<li>And finally, on the contact page, I added a simple email contact form, connected to the Formspree service.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The choice of design</h3>

The design I chose represents my values in some ways:
<ul>
  <li>The petrol blue color evokes a sense of depth and elegance. This brings me back to my introversion and curiosity about the things in life..</li>
  <li>Single elements and essential geometry represent my precision in details.</li>
  <li>Empty spaces and a minimal design evoke my sense of simplicity and importance towards essential things..</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

This website has put me to the test. <br> <br>
I tried to include all the necessary information and successfully resolved many issues. <br>
That's why I have learned how to deal with them without getting stressed if something goes wrong. I have improved my grasp on certain technical aspects and have changed my outlook on many things. <br>
I used only HTML and CSS without the help of preset elements and other programming languages, and for this reason, it was a big challenge that I was happy to be able to complete.
